  b. `docker system prune` -> delete cached containers
  c. `docker-compose up --build` -> rebuild containers

**2. setup a service on Kong Manager**

- host: 1.55.137.70
- protocol: tcp
- port: 7222

**3. setup a route**

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:2001/services/mq/routes \
 --data "protocols[]=tcp" \
 --data "name=tcp-route" \
 --data "destinations[1].port=9000"
```

# Setup JMS client

**1. navigate to ./jms folder**

**2. rename the lib/tibjms.jar to tibjms-1.0.jar**

**3. import the tibjms-1.0.jar to this directory on your local maven repo**

- if the below path doesn't exist, create it first
- `/Users/<replace-user>/.m2/repository/com/tibco/tibjms/1.0`

# Execution

**1. run the java app**
